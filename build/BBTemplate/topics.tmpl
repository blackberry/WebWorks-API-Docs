<h1>API Reference - Topics</h1>
<p>You can view the API reference in a few different layouts. The Topics layout was created to group APIs into meaningful topics, such as BBM, Data Storage, Media, and so on. 
                    If you want to see All classes, please use the navigation on the left to select the appropriate layout.</p>
